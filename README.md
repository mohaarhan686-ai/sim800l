# 🔌 Typical Connections

## ESP32 ↔ SIM800L

| ESP32              | SIM800 |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| GPIO16             | TX     |
| GPIO17             | RX     |
| GND                | GND    |
| External 4V Supply | VCC    |

## Arduino UNO ↔ SIM800L

| Arduino            | SIM800                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| D7 (RX)            | TX                         |
| D8 (TX)            | RX *(Use Voltage Divider)* |
| GND                | GND                        |
| External 4V Supply | VCC                        |

# ⚠ Important Notes

* Use a **stable 3.8V–4.2V external power supply** capable of supplying up to **2A peak current**.
* Do **not** power the SIM800L directly from the Arduino 5V pin.
* Use a voltage divider when connecting **Arduino UNO TX (5V)** to **SIM800 RX**.
* ESP8266 and ESP32 use **3.3V logic**, so a voltage divider is generally not required.
* Ensure your network operator still supports **2G GSM**, as SIM800 series modules are 2G-only.
